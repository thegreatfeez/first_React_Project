# Thegreatfeez – React Profile Card

This is my **first React project**, built with **React + TailwindCSS**. It’s a simple and responsive profile card that reflects my interest in **blockchain** and **crypto development**.


---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- FontAwesome

---

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive layout (works without scroll on both mobile and desktop)
- Component-based structure:
  - `ProfileImage`
  - `ProfileMain`
  - `ProfileFooter`
- FontAwesome icons for social and email links
- Personal brand and interests displayed

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Tailwind setup not the way I’m used to (had to install via npm instead of CDN)
- FontAwesome import is different in React — icons are imported one-by-one
- Images must be placed in `/public` or handled with import
- Tailwind classes needed tweaking for mobile responsiveness
